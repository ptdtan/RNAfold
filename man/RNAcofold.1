.SH SYNOPSIS
.B RNAcofold
[\fI\,OPTIONS\/\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
RNAcofold 2.2.10
.PP
calculate secondary structures of two RNAs with dimerization
.PP
The program works much like RNAfold, but allows one to specify two RNA
sequences which are then allowed to form a dimer structure. RNA sequences are
read from stdin in the usual format, i.e. each line of input corresponds to one
sequence, except for lines starting with ">" which contain the name of the
next sequence.
To compute the hybrid structure of two molecules, the two sequences must be
concatenated using the \e'&\e' character as separator.
RNAcofold can compute minimum free energy (mfe) structures, as well as
partition function (pf) and base pairing probability matrix (using the \fB\-p\fR
switch)
Since dimer formation is concentration dependent, RNAcofold can be used to
compute equilibrium concentrations for all five monomer and (homo/hetero)\-dimer
species, given input concentrations for the monomers.
Output consists of the mfe structure in bracket notation as well as PostScript
structure plots and "dot plot" files containing the pair probabilities, see
the RNAfold man page for details. In the dot plots a cross marks the chain
break between the two concatenated sequences.
The program will continue to read new sequences until a line consisting of the
single character @ or an end of file condition is encountered.

.SS "General Options:"
.IP
Command line options which alter the general behavior of this program
.TP
\fB\-\-noPS\fR
Do not produce postscript drawing of the mfe
structure.
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-\-noconv\fR
Do not automatically substitute nucleotide
"T" with "U"
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-\-auto\-id\fR
Automatically generate an ID for each sequence.
(default=off)
.IP
The default mode of RNAcofold is to automatically determine an ID from the
input sequence data if the input file format allows to do that. Sequence IDs
are usually given in the FASTA header of input sequences. If this flag is
active, RNAcofold ignores any IDs retrieved from the input and automatically
generates an ID for each sequence. This ID consists of a prefix and an
increasing number. This flag can also be used to add a FASTA header to the
output even if the input has none.
.TP
\fB\-\-id\-prefix\fR=\fI\,prefix\/\fR
Prefix for automatically generated IDs (as used
in output file names)
.IP
(default=`sequence')
.IP
If this parameter is set, each sequence will be prefixed with the provided
string. Hence, the output files will obey the following naming scheme:
"prefix_xxxx_ss.ps" (secondary structure plot), "prefix_xxxx_dp.ps"
(dot\-plot), "prefix_xxxx_dp2.ps" (stack probabilities), etc. where xxxx is
the sequence number. Note: Setting this parameter implies \fB\-\-auto\-id\fR.
.TP
\fB\-\-id\-digits\fR=\fI\,INT\/\fR
Specify the number of digits of the counter in
automatically generated alignment IDs.
.IP
(default=`4')
.IP
When alignments IDs are automatically generated, they receive an increasing
number, starting with 1. This number will always be left\-padded by leading
zeros, such that the number takes up a certain width. Using this parameter,
the width can be specified to the users need. We allow numbers in the range
[1:18]. This option implies \fB\-\-auto\-id\fR.
.TP
\fB\-\-id\-start\fR=\fI\,LONG\/\fR
Specify the first number in automatically
generated alignment IDs.
.IP
(default=`1')
.IP
When sequence IDs are automatically generated, they receive an increasing
number, usually starting with 1. Using this parameter, the first number can
be specified to the users requirements. Note: negative numbers are not
allowed.
Note: Setting this parameter implies to ignore any IDs retrieved from the
input data, i.e. it activates the \fB\-\-auto\-id\fR flag.
.SS "Structure Constraints:"
.IP
Command line options to interact with the structure constraints feature of
this program
.TP
\fB\-C\fR, \fB\-\-constraint[=\fR<filename>] Calculate structures subject to constraints.
(default=`')
.IP
The program reads first the sequence, then a string containing constraints on
the structure encoded with the symbols:
.IP
\&. (no constraint for this base)
.IP
| (the corresponding base has to be paired
.IP
x (the base is unpaired)
.IP
< (base i is paired with a base j>i)
.IP
\f(CW> (base i is paired with a base j<i)\fR
.IP
and matching brackets ( ) (base i pairs base j)
.IP
With the exception of "|", constraints will disallow all pairs conflicting
with the constraint. This is usually sufficient to enforce the constraint,
but occasionally a base may stay unpaired in spite of constraints. PF folding
ignores constraints of type "|".
.TP
\fB\-\-canonicalBPonly\fR
Remove non\-canonical base pairs from the
structure constraint
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-\-enforceConstraint\fR
Enforce base pairs given by round brackets ( )
in structure constraint
.IP
(default=off)
.SS "Algorithms:"
.IP
Select additional algorithms which should be included in the calculations.
The Minimum free energy (MFE) and a structure representative are calculated
in any case.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-partfunc\fR[=\fI\,INT\/\fR]
Calculate the partition function and base
pairing probability matrix in addition to the
mfe structure. Default is calculation of mfe
structure only.
.IP
(default=`1')
.IP
In addition to the MFE structure we print a coarse representation of the pair
probabilities in form of a pseudo bracket notation, followed by the ensemble
free energy, as well as the centroid structure derived from the pair
probabilities together with its free energy and distance to the ensemble.
Finally it prints the frequency of the mfe structure, and the structural
diversity (mean distance between the structures in the ensemble).
See the description of pf_fold() and mean_bp_dist() and centroid() in the
RNAlib documentation for details.
Note that unless you also specify \fB\-d2\fR or \fB\-d0\fR, the partition function and mfe
calculations will use a slightly different energy model. See the discussion
of dangling end options below.
.IP
An additionally passed value to this option changes the behavior of partition
function calculation:
.IP
In order to calculate the partition function but not the pair probabilities
.IP
use the \fB\-p0\fR option and save about
.IP
50% in runtime. This prints the ensemble free energy \fB\-kT\fR ln(Z).
.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-all_pf\fR
Compute the partition function and free
energies not only of the hetero\-dimer
consisting of the two input sequences (the
"AB dimer"), but also of the homo\-dimers AA
and BB as well as A and B monomers.
.IP
(default=off)
.IP
The output will contain the free energies for each of these species, as well
as 5 dot plots containing the conditional pair probabilities, called
ABname5.ps, AAname5.ps and so on. For later use, these dot plot files also
contain the free energy of the ensemble as a comment. Using \fB\-a\fR automatically
toggles the \fB\-p\fR option.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-concentrations\fR
In addition to everything listed under the \fB\-a\fR
option, read in initial monomer
concentrations and compute the expected
equilibrium concentrations of the 5 possible
species (AB, AA, BB, A, B).
.IP
(default=off)
.IP
Start concentrations are read from stdin (unless the \fB\-f\fR option is used) in
[mol/l], equilibrium concentrations are given realtive to the sum of the two
inputs. An arbitrary number of initial concentrations can be specified (one
pair of concentrations per line).
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-concfile\fR=\fI\,filename\/\fR
Specify a file with initial concentrations for
the two sequences.
.IP
The table consits of arbitrary many lines with just two numbers (the
concentration of sequence A and B). This option will automatically toggle the
\fB\-c\fR (and thus \fB\-a\fR and \fB\-p\fR) options (see above).
.TP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-pfScale\fR=\fI\,scaling\/\fR factor
In the calculation of the pf use scale*mfe as
an estimate for the ensemble free energy
(used to avoid overflows).
.IP
The default is 1.07, useful values are 1.0 to 1.2. Occasionally needed for
long sequences.
You can also recompile the program to use double precision (see the README
file).
.TP
\fB\-\-bppmThreshold=\fR<value>
Set the threshold for base pair probabilities
included in the postscript output
.IP
(default=`1e\-5')
.IP
By setting the threshold the base pair probabilities that are included in the
output can be varied. By default only those exceeding 1e\-5 in probability
will be shown as squares in the dot plot. Changing the threshold to any other
value allows for increase or decrease of data.
.TP
\fB\-g\fR, \fB\-\-gquad\fR
Incoorporate G\-Quadruplex formation into the
structure prediction algorithm.
.IP
(default=off)
.SS "Model Details:"
.TP
\fB\-T\fR, \fB\-\-temp\fR=\fI\,DOUBLE\/\fR
Rescale energy parameters to a temperature of
temp C. Default is 37C.
.TP
\fB\-4\fR, \fB\-\-noTetra\fR
Do not include special tabulated stabilizing
energies for tri\-, tetra\- and hexaloop
hairpins.
.IP
(default=off)
.IP
Mostly for testing.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-dangles\fR=\fI\,INT\/\fR
How to treat "dangling end" energies for
bases adjacent to helices in free ends and
multi\-loops
.IP
(default=`2')
.IP
With \fB\-d1\fR only unpaired bases can participate in at most one dangling end,
this is the default for mfe folding but unsupported for the partition
function folding.
.IP
With \fB\-d2\fR this check is ignored, dangling energies will be added for the bases
adjacent to a helix on both sides in any case; this is the default for
partition function folding (\fB\-p\fR).
The option \fB\-d0\fR ignores dangling ends altogether (mostly for debugging).
With \fB\-d3\fR mfe folding will allow coaxial stacking of adjacent helices in
multi\-loops. At the moment the implementation will not allow coaxial stacking
of the two interior pairs in a loop of degree 3 and works only for mfe
folding.
.IP
Note that by default (as well as with \fB\-d1\fR and \fB\-d3\fR) pf and mfe folding treat
dangling ends differently. Use \fB\-d2\fR in addition to \fB\-p\fR to ensure that both
algorithms use the same energy model.
.TP
\fB\-\-noLP\fR
Produce structures without lonely pairs
(helices of length 1).
.IP
(default=off)
.IP
For partition function folding this only disallows pairs that can only occur
isolated. Other pairs may still occasionally occur as helices of length 1.
.TP
\fB\-\-noGU\fR
Do not allow GU pairs
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-\-noClosingGU\fR
Do not allow GU pairs at the end of helices
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-P\fR, \fB\-\-paramFile\fR=\fI\,paramfile\/\fR
Read energy parameters from paramfile, instead
of using the default parameter set.
.IP
A sample parameter file should accompany your distribution.
See the RNAlib documentation for details on the file format.
.TP
\fB\-\-nsp\fR=\fI\,STRING\/\fR
Allow other pairs in addition to the usual
AU,GC,and GU pairs.
.IP
Its argument is a comma separated list of additionally allowed pairs. If the
first character is a "\-" then AB will imply that AB and BA are allowed
pairs.
e.g. RNAfold \fB\-nsp\fR \fB\-GA\fR  will allow GA and AG pairs. Nonstandard pairs are
given 0 stacking energy.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-energyModel\fR=\fI\,INT\/\fR
Rarely used option to fold sequences from the
artificial ABCD... alphabet, where A pairs B,
C\-D etc.  Use the energy parameters for GC
(\fB\-e\fR 1) or AU (\fB\-e\fR 2) pairs.
.TP
\fB\-\-betaScale\fR=\fI\,DOUBLE\/\fR
Set the scaling of the Boltzmann factors
(default=`1.')
.IP
The argument provided with this option enables to scale the thermodynamic
temperature used in the Boltzmann factors independently from the temperature
used to scale the individual energy contributions of the loop types. The
Boltzmann factors then become exp(\fB\-dG\fR/(kT*betaScale)) where k is the
Boltzmann constant, dG the free energy contribution of the state and T the
absolute temperature.
